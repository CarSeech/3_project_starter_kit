  <div>

    <p>- It is a markup language for creating web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

    <div class="csstext">
      <p>
        - CSS is used to enhance the appearance of a webpage. It is the way the website will appear to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        - "Cascading" means that 'rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        - However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.'

        <p> An Html page is the rendition of several elements by a browser, made flashy/presentable by CSS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Prcedural thinking means creating unambiguous computer instructions. By doing this, there leaves no room for ambiguity, which would otherwise result in errors. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> We use <span>divs</span> to add structure to our html document. It also helps with ease of styling when CSS is implemented. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Try using classes more than id when working with CSS as large amounts of ids can slow down browser rendering.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>HTML elementsÂ are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.</p>
