      <h3><a name = "Smry"> Summary </a> </h3>
      <p> I'm currently studying e-commerce development and I'm learning the basics of database management systems, specifically realtional databases. During the course of my study, I was introduced to Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. However,
        I still feel like there is so much more for me to learn.
      </p>
      <p> What has me a little apprehensive, is that I currently don't have any work related experience for what I'm currently studying, besides mostly hardware repair, customer service, retail and financial bacgrounds. Soon I'll be doing my internship and
        I'm trying my best to be prepared for what is to come.
      </p>
      <p> As part of my plan, I will try to work on a number of projects over the summer through several online classes, get my A+ certification and build overall confidence in my abilites. I am hoping by creating a portfolio of working projects and a basic
        certification, that it will put me at a slight advantage over my pairs.

      <h3><a name = "Hobs"> Hobbies </a></h3>
      <p> One of my favorite hobbies is cycling, specifically mountain biking.I love exploring new trails and to feel the adrenalne rush as I speed downhill. As a kid I often found myself on a bicycle, because it was the fastest thing I owned. It also gives
        me good cardio workouts.

      </p>
      <p> I recently picked up snowboarding and I'm a natural and ice-skating (no fancy tricks though). Snowboarding give me a similar feeling to cycling, in terms of speed and also gives you a good leg workout. I'm still a novice in snowboarding, but I will
        frequent it as more funds become available (I'm broke).
      </p>
      <p> Another hobby I have is photography. I love the science behind mapping photons on a graph to create vivid images and to manipulate light to grant different and unique results. I however, need to make more time to go out and capture these moments.

      <h3><a name = "Intrts"> Interests</a></h3>
      <p> Im interested in cars (primarily self autonomous, electric vehicles). The battery hasn't advanced as fast as hardware and software. It's the only thing keeping us back from having cellphones that last several months on a single charge.
      </p>
      <p> I'm also interested in Artificial Intelligence. I believe that we need the help of machines in order to advance at a much faster pace. Elon Musk is taking one step at it by trying to make our species interplanetary -(incase all goes to shits on Earth)-
        and investing heavily in the benefits of AI.

      <h3><a name = "Psn"> Passion </a> </h3>
      <p>
        Honestly, this is still a work in progress. When I think of something that I'm passionate about, I think of anything that can increase my knowledge. I believe in self or continous improvement.I'm still tring to find my absolute true passion.
